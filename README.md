# eatUp!

This project was generated with the [Angular Full-Stack Generator](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack) version 3.3.0.

eatUp! is a social app that allows users to view what other diners have rated food items on the menu. It also gives users the ability to rate the food items.

## Technology Stack

THE MEAN STACK
-MongoDB
-Express
-AngularJS
-Node.JS


### Prerequisites

- [Git]
- [Node.js and npm]
- [Bower](bower.io)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/)


## Build & development

Used gulp instead of grunt for previewing changes.

## API

Created my own API.
Tried to use OpenMenu's API for the full menu. However, one of their requirements was that the request be submitted using sending an email using your companies domain (no generic emails like Yahoo or Gmail)

## Problems Faced

The Full-Stack Generator
-The set up was different. It also came with a lot of quirks that I was not ready to handle.

Controllers and Directives
-I need more practice. My head was spinning.
## Future Plans

Add user interaction (comments, likes, etc.)

Would like to add ability to upload pics with meals.

Would like the user to have the option to add restaurants.
